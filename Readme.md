## Childcare Deserts Visualization (version 2)

### Getting started

1) [Install nodejs version 8 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

    Or, if [you have `yarn` installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (often has better performance and guarantees),

    ```shell
    yarn
    ```



3) start the development server

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
